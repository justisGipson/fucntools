# FUNCTOOLS

the `functools` module offers many useful higher order functions that act on or return other functions, which we can leverage to implement function caching, overloading, creating decorators and in general to make our code a bit more functional

`functools` features a lot of useful functions and decorators that can make you life easier, but this module is really just a tip of an iceberg
